For example:\r\n\r\n    python\r\n    # L10N: Here the tip for translators\r\n    # Thanks\r\n    print _(\"A translatable string\")\r\n\r\nTranslators will see:\r\n\r\n    L10N: Here the tip for translators\r\n    Thanks\r\n\r\n\r\n### Update templates ###\r\n\r\nTo update POT files type:\r\n\r\n    paver generate_locale\r\n\r\nTo automatically upload the updated POTs on Crowdin for the localization process just type:\r\n\r\n    paver upload_translations -k [api_key]\r\n\r\nthe API Key can be retrieved in the Settings panel of the project on Crowdin. This is allowed only to the administrators.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Retrieve PO files ###\r\n\r\nUpdated PO files can be automatically download from Crowdin typing:\r\n\r\n    paver download_translations -k [api_key]\r\n\r\nThis is allowed only to administrators, **users can download the last version of the translations using the Crowdin web interface**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compile PO files ###\r\n\r\nMO files can be generated typing:\r\n\r\n    paver compile_translations\r\n\r\nTo compile a single file just use command `msgfmt`.\r\nFor example to compile a core.po file type:\r\n\r\n    msgfmt -o core.mo core.po\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensing\r\n---------\r\n\r\n### Main program  ###\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached [LICENSE.md](/LICENSE.md) for the extended license.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Plugins  ###\r\n\r\nAccording to the terms of the pyLoad license, official plugins must be treated as an extension of the main program\r\nand released under the same license of pyLoad or a compatible one:\r\n\r\n * Any plugin published **without the \\_\\_license\\_\\_ attribute** is implied published under the same license of pyLoad.\r\n * Only plugins published **with a compatible license** will be accepted as official and included in the pyLoad repository.\r\n * **Un-official plugins are not supported**, so any issue report or feature request regarding this kind of plugin will be rejected.\r\n * Is recommended to put a **shorten** license notice only if nedfull to avoid misunderstandings about the adopted license.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlugin policy\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n - No cracking website or service\r\n - No drugs website or service\r\n - No e-commerce website or service\r\n - No government website or service\r\n - No illegal website or service in the country where its servers are located\r\n - No pedopornography website or service\r\n - No private website or service\r\n - No racist website or service\r\n - No warez website or service\r\n - No weapon website or service\r\n - ...\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the attached [CREDITS.md](/CREDITS.md) for the extended credits.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
